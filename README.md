## ü§©Introduction

  The CounterApp is a web application that features a central counter initially set to zero and a toggleable leaderboard component. Utilizing RainbowKit for Ethereum wallet interactions and Wagmi for configuration, the app employs local storage for persistent count value storage. Users can increment the count with a dedicated button. The Petra Wallet integration allows users to connect their wallets, with the connected wallet information, including the address and icon, dynamically displayed on the UI. This seamless integration enhances user engagement, providing a personalized experience within the CounterApp.

## ü™∂Features

  The Leaderboard component in the CounterApp serves as a visual representation of the user engagement within the application. When users increment the count, their activity contributes to their position on the leaderboard. The leaderboard showcases the counts of various users, offering a competitive and interactive element to the app. Through RainbowKit and Wagmi integration, the app ensures a streamlined and secure connection to Ethereum wallets, allowing users to have a personalized and engaging experience while tracking and comparing their count achievements on the leaderboard.
